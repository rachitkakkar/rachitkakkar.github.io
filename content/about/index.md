I'm an engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and currently a researcher at the Applied Research Laboratories at UT. I'm an avid programmer, experimenting with technology in some form or the other since 5th grade. I will expand this section in due time. In the meantime, please refer to my blog and my GitHub.
