Hello, Iâ€™m Rachit Kakkar! I'm a high school student at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA) in Austin, TX. I am highly passionate about programming, along with history, investing, and video production. My passion for programming began when I first learned python in 5th grade and grew as I participated in every programming class my middle school had to offer, as well started participating in Air Force Association's Cyberpatriot (where my team won first in the state and top ten nationally).

My passion for programming now manifests itself in the many programs I code in my free time, which can be found at my Github along with writeups on my blog. In addition, I am captain of my school's official computer science club and survey club (where I manage the website) and continue to participate in Cyberpatriot. Recently, I joined my high school's FIRST FRC Robotics team (418) where I am on the programming team and help out with outreach. I have had a blast learning about a completely new area of programming.

Academically, I have continued to educate myself on CS by taking classes such as AP Computer Science and Digital Electronics. Digital Electronics in particular has been my favorite class and has taught me the inner workings of the complex circuits that make computers possible, differing drastically from the high level programming I had done previously.

My other passions occupy much of my time as well. I read many books and watch many documentaries about history, a habit I have had since a young age. I have been investing my savings in assets such as stocks, ETFs, and index funds ever since I was introduced to personal finance through my CTE Graphic Design class. Finally, I edit many videos for various projects using Adobe Premiere and After Effects.
